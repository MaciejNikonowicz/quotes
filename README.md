# README

Simple app for adding, editing and commenting quotations.

The app uses 'Quote' word as 'Citation' is reserved in Rails.

In the right corner of navbar you will find a button to add quotes. 

All the quotes are listed on index page and you can check detailed info where you can add comment, edit or delete quote.

I was thinking about adding some simple http auth with: http_basic_authenticate_with , however resigned from the idea so that full testing is possible.

There is Master branch for deployment on heroku, develop for writing code and Comments for adding comment functionality.

You can find the app under the address:  https://ciubiapp.herokuapp.com/  (don't mind the name, everything was taken.. )
